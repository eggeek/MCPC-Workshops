\begin{frame}{Problem C: Escher Sequence}
\small  Author: Shizhe Zhao

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Brute-Force: try all possible length from $n$ to $2n$: $O(n^2)$
  \item<3-> Observation: let \texttt{s2=flip(reverse(s))}, then 
  concated string \texttt{s s2} must be an \texttt{Escher Sequence}.
  \item<4-> Minimize the length by removing their maximum common part:
    \texttt{maximize sufix(s) == prefix(s2)}. 
  \item<5-> Can be done by \texttt{KMP}. (Or other string matching algorithms)
  \end{itemize}
