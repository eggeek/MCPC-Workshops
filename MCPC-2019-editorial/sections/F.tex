\small Author: Shizhe Zhao
\begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> Let given $2^k$ by $2^k$ grid map,
    there are exactly $2^{2k-2}$ number of cows in each quadrant.
  \item<3-> Find which quadrant the cow belongs to, and we will deal with 
  a same problem on $2^{k-1}$ by $2^{k-1}$ grid map.
  \item<4-> Repeat such process until $k=0$.
\end{itemize}
