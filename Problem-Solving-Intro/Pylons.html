  Our Battlestarcraft Algorithmica ship is being chased through space by
  persistent robots called Pylons! We have just teleported to a new galaxy to
  try to shake them off of our tail, and we want to stay here for as long as
  possible so we can buy time to plan our next move... but we do not want to
  get caught!
</p><p>
  This galaxy is a flat grid of <b>R</b> rows and <b>C</b> columns; the rows
  are numbered from 1 to <b>R</b> from top to bottom, and the columns are
  numbered from 1 to <b>C</b> from left to right. We can choose which cell to
  start in, and we must continue to jump between cells until we have visited
  each cell in the galaxy <i>exactly</i> once. That is, we can never revisit a
  cell, including our starting cell.
</p><p>
  We do not want to make it too easy for the Pylons to guess where we will go
  next. Each time we jump from our current cell, we must choose a destination
  cell that does not share a row, column, or diagonal with that current cell.
  Let (i, j) denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column; then a jump
  from a current cell (r, c) to a destination cell (r', c') is invalid if and
  only if any of these is true:
</p> <ul><li>r = r'</li> <li>c = c'</li> <li>r - c = r' - c'</li> <li>r + c = r' + c'</li></ul> <p>
  Can you help us find an order in which to visit each of the
  <b>R</b> × <b>C</b> cells, such that the move between any pair of
  consecutive cells in the sequence is valid? Or is it impossible for us to
  escape from the Pylons?
</p> <h3>Input</h3> <p>
  The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>.
  <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each consists of one line containing two
  integers <b>R</b> and <b>C</b>: the numbers of rows and columns in this
  galaxy.
</p> <h3>Output</h3> <p>
  For each test case, output one line containing <code>Case #x: y</code>,
  where <code>y</code> is a string of uppercase letters: either
  <code>POSSIBLE</code> or <code>IMPOSSIBLE</code>, according to whether it is
  possible to fulfill the conditions in the problem statement. Then, if it is
  possible, output <b>R</b> × <b>C</b> more lines. The i-th of these
  lines represents the i-th cell you will visit (counting starting from 1), and
  should contain two integers r<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>i</sub>: the row and
  column of that cell. Note that the first of these lines represents your
  chosen starting cell.
</p> <h3>Limits</h3> <p>
  Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.<br>

  2 ≤ <b>C</b> ≤ 5.<br></p> <h4>Test set 2 (Hidden)</h4> <p>
  1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 100.<br>
  2 ≤ <b>R</b> ≤ 20.<br>
  2 ≤ <b>C</b> ≤ 20.<br></p> <h3>Sample</h3> <div class="problem-io-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><td><br> <span class="io-table-header">Input</span> <br>&nbsp;

  In Sample Case #1, no matter which starting cell we choose, we have nowhere
  to jump, since all of the remaining cells share a row, column, or diagonal
  with our starting cell.
</p><p>
  In Sample Case #2, we have chosen the cell in row 2, column 3 as our starting
  cell.  Notice that it is fine for our final cell to share a row, column, or
  diagonal with our starting cell. The following diagram shows the order in
  which the cells are visited:
